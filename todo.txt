Steps
+ Removed my existing wahidsadik.github.io repo from GH
+ Forked this https://github.com/poole/hyde; renamed the repo to wahidsadik.github.io. I already have a Hyde based website at http://wahidsadik.github.io
+ My new repo is at: https://github.com/wahidsadik/wahidsadik.github.io
+ Removed my existing local clone of the site, and recloned it.
+ Editd the CNAME file to point to this: http://wahidsadik.github.io
+ Updated some of the builtin files, and pushed. Awesome.

// Remove gh-pages branch, which I do not need
git checkout -t origin/gh-pages
git checkout master
git branch -D gh-pages
git push origin --delete gh-pages
